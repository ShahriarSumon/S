# RCPY - Native Ads RecyclerView example 

![App with Ad gif](app-with-ad.gif) ![App with Ad Wireframe](app-with-ad-wireframe.png)

This is an example of integrating a [Native Ad](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/audience-network/android-native) in a Recycler View.

It's a sample recipe app where native ads will show up in the feed on the 5th entry.

Note that all the tabs will just load RecipeFragment - this is expected.
